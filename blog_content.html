                    <p>When someone asks me what an entrepreneur needs to become successful, rarely do I hear ‘the ability to separate’
                        <br>
                        Instead, I hear qualities like tenacity, knowledge, passion, motivation, savvy. And a must-have good idea.
                        <br>
                        Whilst I can’t deny those qualities are important, they aren’t nearly as effective if you don’t know how to one thing well. And that is to separate yourself from business and personal.
                        <br>
                        I speak from experience.
                        <br>
                        Separation has been my downfall. When I first quit my job and started my now-defunct website design business, I didn’t anticipate how crucial separation was. I let my time become blurred between working and playing. I took more days off than I had worked. I let every part of my home become a workspace. I was blurring the lines, and my business and I were suffering terribly from it.
                        <br>
                        Separation isn’t something many prepare you for when becoming an entrepreneur. Or business owner. For a lot of people, they think it’s implied. It’s just good business sense, right?!
                        <br>
                        And whilst they are right, it isn’t common sense for everyone.
                        <br>
                        I’m here to ensure you don’t make the same mistakes as me. Here explains the art of separation every entrepreneur needs for their business. And the perils of thinking you don’t need to define your personal life from your professional.
